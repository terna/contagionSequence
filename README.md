About **S.I.s.a.R.**, An Agent-Based Model of the Diffusion of Covid-19 Using NetLogo, with Susceptible, Infected, symptomatic, asymptomatic, and Recovered people (+), look at [https://terna.to.it/simul/SIsaR.html](https://terna.to.it/simul/SIsaR.html).



## Two goals here:


### 1 contagion sequences

**Visualization of the sequences of contagions in SIsaR**, using

     sequentialRecords.ipynb


Read about the visualization technique in [howItWorks.txt](howItWorks.txt).

You can run this sequence analyzer via [![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge_logo.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/terna/contagionSequence/master?filepath=sequentialRecords.ipynb)

### 2 contagion series

**Visualization of the series of contagions in SIsaR**, using

     contagionSeriesByGroups.ipynb

 (+) The model uses structural data of Piedmont, an Italian region, but you can calibrate it for other areas following the Info sheet. It follows a calendar of events (comments in Italian there).
